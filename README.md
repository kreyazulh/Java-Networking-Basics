# Java-Networking-Basics
Simple practice codes on socket programming, threading and a workable chat application.

## Basic_Socket_Uppercase
Client sends a text to server and server returns the same text back to client with all uppercase.

## Basic_Threading
Main thread and runnable thread implementation.

## Threading_Producer_Consumer
A blocking queue is used to simulate a cafe where chef(producer) makes cakes and customer consumes it. Think of it as a table, where 4 cakes can be placed at most at a time. So producer rests when there is 4 cakes on the table. Consumers wait when all the cakes are finished.

## ChatApplication
Simple group chat and personal chat visualization among clients that connect to the server. Name changing features are implemented as well.
